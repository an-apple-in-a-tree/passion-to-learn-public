“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” 
					- Aristotle
- An educated mind is able to critically evaluate and consider a differing opinions that do not align with their own worldview. This is important because while we hold our personal worldviews to a great degree of certainty (ie. we trust in them a lot and believe that we are correct), worldviews have their own pitfalls including brain biases, Our worldviews are a collection of ideals and values that we possess through the influence of our cultures and personal experiences. While our worldviews guide us through our decision-making processes in many different areas such as politics and religion

“It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.” 
			

Terminology
Knowledge: some representation of the world as it is
Fact: knowledge claim of the world that we are certain of
Opinion: is a knowledge claim that an individual believes to be true based on their certainty of facts in the world (opinion/point of view)

Certainty: (a state of mind) is the extent to which the individual believes their opinion to be fact
How convinced we are of the truth of the knowledge, not how true it is
Certainty
Indisputable - death
Dubious - the earth is flat
Criminal court - shadow of a reasonable doubt; must need proof of someone committing a crime
Civil court- lower bar; looking at likely probability instead of needing certain proof
Rational Certainty- justified, reasoned, with evidence (selected to support beliefs, usually never complete; cherry picking due to the quality of evidence)
Irrational Certainty - based on intuition faith (not always wrong)
Appear to be supported by evidence (rationalization, cherry-picking, confirmation bias, sweeping generalizations)
Scientists accept uncertainty (absolute certainty is avoided)
Skepticism
